# Week2
Find the materials we used for Week 2 of the Programming Everything with Python Course (PREP).

NOTE: If you are making a project, it is a good habit to have it under the MIT License (though there are other available) as it promotes healthy re-use.

This Repository is under the MIT License which is a permissive license, that puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, reasonable license compatibility.
